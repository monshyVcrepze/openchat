Pro Evolution Soccer 2010 (PES 2010) is a popular football video game developed by Konami and released in 2009. The game features various modes, teams, players, stadiums and realistic gameplay. One of the aspects that enhances the immersion of the game is the commentary, which provides analysis, reactions and information about the match.
 
PES 2010 offers different languages for the commentary, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian and Portuguese. However, some fans of the game wanted to have more options, such as Serbian. Serbian is a South Slavic language spoken by about 12 million people, mainly in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Kosovo.
