You play as Quincy, a hapless guy who gets invited to a suspicious party by a mysterious woman. There, he discovers a time machine that allows him to travel back and forth between different moments of the night. However, things get complicated when he realizes that someone is killing the guests in gruesome ways, and he might be the only one who can stop it.
 
But who is the killer? And why are they doing this? And what is the deal with the cat? And why does everything seem so familiar? These are some of the questions that you will have to answer as you explore the mansion, interact with the characters, and witness the events unfold in different timelines.
 
Impostor Factory is not a typical point-and-click game. It has no puzzles, no inventory, no combat, and no branching paths. Instead, it focuses on delivering a captivating story with memorable characters, witty dialogue, emotional moments, and surprising twists. It also features a beautiful pixel art style and an original soundtrack composed by Kan Gao.
 
If you are a fan of To the Moon and Finding Paradise, you will be happy to know that Impostor Factory is connected to them in some way. However, you don't need to play them before playing this game, as it can be enjoyed as a standalone experience. Impostor Factory is also shorter than its predecessors, lasting about 3-4 hours on average.
 
So what are you waiting for? If you are looking for a game that will make you laugh, cry, gasp, and curse at the screen, then Impostor Factory is the game for you. You can download it for free from GOG Unlocked[^1^] or buy it from Steam[^2^] right now. Trust me, you won't regret it.
  
Impostor Factory has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and players alike, who praised its engaging story, charming characters, witty dialogue, emotional moments, and surprising twists.
